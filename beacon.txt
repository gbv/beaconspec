Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


1.  Introduction

   BEACON is a data interchange format for large numbers of uniform
   links.  A BEACON *link dump* consists of:

   o  a set of links (Section 2),

   o  a set of meta fields (Section 3).

   Each link consists of a source URI, a target URI, and an annotation.
   Common patterns in source URIs and target URIs respectively can be
   used to abbreviate links.  This specification defines:

   o  two serializations of link dumps (*BEACON files*) in a condense
      line-oriented format and in an XML format (Section 4),

   o  two interpretations of link dumps as mapping to HTML and mapping
      to RDF (Section 5).

   The current specification is managed at https://github.com/gbv/
   beaconspec .

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal grammar rules in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC5234], including the ABNF core rules "HTAB", "LF",
   "CR", and "SP".  In addition, the minus operator ("-") is used to
   exclude line breaks and vertical bars from the rules LINE and TOKEN:

    LINE       =  *CHAR - ( *CHAR LINEBREAK *CHAR )

    TOKEN      =  *CHAR - ( *CHAR ( LINEBREAK / VBAR ) *CHAR )

    LINEBREAK  =  LF | CR LF | CR   ; "\n", "\r\n", or "\r"

    VBAR       =  %x7C              ; vertical bar ("|")

   RDF in this document is expressed in Turtle syntax [TURTLE].  The
   following namespace prefixes are used to refer to RDF properties and
   classes from the RDF and RDFS vocabularies [RDF], the DCMI Metadata
   Terms [DCTERMS], the FOAF vocabulary [FOAF], the VoID vocabulary
   [VOID], and the RSS 1.0 Syndication Module [RSSSYND]:

    void:    <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#>
    rssynd:  <http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/>

   The blank node ":dump" denotes the URI of the link dump and the blank
   node ":targetset" denotes the URI of the target dataset.

1.2.  String normalization

   A Unicode string is normalized according to this specification, by
   stripping leading and trailing whitespace and by replacing all
   "WHITESPACE" character sequences by a single space ("SP").

    WHITESPACE  =  1*( CR | LF | HTAB | SP )

   The set of allowed Unicode characters in BEACON dumps is the set of
   valid Unicode characters from UCS which can also be expressed in XML
   1.0, excluding some discouraged control characters:

    CHAR        =  WHITESPACE / %x21-7E / %xA0-D7FF / %xE000-FFFD
                /  %x10000-1FFFD / %x20000-2FFFD / %x30000-3FFFD
                /  %x40000-4FFFD / %x50000-5FFFD / %x60000-6FFFD
                /  %x70000-7FFFD / %x80000-8FFFD / %x90000-9FFFD
                /  %xA0000-AFFFD / %xB0000-BFFFD / %xC0000-CFFFD
                /  %xD0000-DFFFD / %xE0000-EFFFD / %xF0000-FFFFD
                /  %x10000-10FFFD

   Applications SHOULD exclude disallowed characters by stripping them,
   by replacing them with the replacement character "U+FFFD", or by
   refusing to process.  Applications SHOULD also apply Unicode
   Normalization Form Canonical Composition (NFKC) to all strings.

1.3.  URI patterns

   A URI pattern in this specification is an URI Template, as defined in
   [RFC6570], with all template expressions being either "{ID}" for
   simple string expansion or "{+ID}" for reserved expansion.

   A URI pattern is used to construct a URI by replacing all template
   expressions with an identifier value.  All identifier characters in
   the "unreserved" range from [RFC3986], and characters in the
   "reserved" range or character sequences matching the "pct-encoded"
   rule for expressions being "{+ID}", are copied literally.  All other
   characters are copied to the URI as the sequence of pct-encoded
   triplets corresponding to that character's encoding in UTF-8

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   [RFC3629].  The referenced character ranges are imported here from
   [RFC3986] for convenience:

    pct-encoded    =  "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
    unreserved     =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
    reserved       =  gen-delims / sub-delims
    gen-delims     =  ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
    sub-delims     =  "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                   /  "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

   A URI pattern is allowed to contain the broader set of characters
   allowed in Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) [RFC3987].
   The URI constructed from a URI pattern by template processing can be
   transformed to an IRI by following the process defined in Section 3.2
   of [RFC3987].

    Example value    Expression   Copied as

     path/dir          {ID}        path%2Fdir
     path/dir          {+ID}       path/dir
     Hello World!      {ID}        Hello%20World%21
     Hello World!      {+ID}       Hello%20World!
     Hello%20World     {ID}        Hello%2520World
     Hello%20World     {+ID}       Hello%20World
     M%C3%BCller       {ID}        M%25C3%25BCller
     M%C3%BCller       {+ID}       M%C3%BCller

2.  Links

   A link in a link dump is a directed connection between two resources
   that are identified by URIs [RFC3986].  A link is compromised of
   three elements:

   o  a *source URI*,

   o  a *target URI*,

   o  an *annotation*.

   Source URI and target URI define where a link is pointing from and to
   respectively.  The annotation is an optional whitespace-normalized
   Unicode string that can be used to further describe the link or parts
   of it.  A missing annotation is equal to the empty string.
   Annotations MUST match the grammar rule "TOKEN".  The meaning of a
   link can be indicated by the *relation type* (Section 2.2) meta
   field.

2.1.  Link construction

   Link elements are given in abbreviated form of *link tokens* when
   serialized in a BEACON file.  Each link is constructed from:

   o  a mandatory source token

   o  an optional annotation token

   o  an optional target token, which is set to the source token if
      missing

   All tokens MUST be whitespace-normalized before further processing.
   The full link is then constructed as following:

   o  The source URI is constructed from the "prefix" meta field URI
      pattern by inserting the source token, as defined in Section 1.3.

   o  The target URI is constructed from the "target" meta field URI
      pattern by inserting the target token, as as defined in
      Section 1.3.

   o  The annotation is constructed from the "message" meta field by
      literally replacing every occurrence of the character sequence
      "{annotation}" by the annotation token.  The resulting string MUST
      be whitespace-normalized after construction additional encoding
      MUST NOT be applied.

   The following table illustrates construction of a link:

    meta field  +  link token  -->  link element
   ----------------------------------------------
    prefix      |  source       |   source URI
    target      |  target       |   target URI
    message     |  annotation   |   annotation

   Constructed source URI and target URI MUST be syntactically valid.
   Applications MUST ignore links with invalid URIs and SHOULD give a
   warning.  Note that annotation tokens are always ignored if the
   "message" meta field does not contain the sequence "{annotation}".
   Applications SHOULD give a warning in this case.

   Applications MUST NOT differentiate between equal links constructed
   from different abbreviations.  For instance the following BEACON text
   file contains a single link:

    #PREFIX: http://example.org/
    #TARGET: http://example.com/
    #MESSAGE: Hello World!

    foo

   The same link could also be serialized without any meta fields:

    http://example.org/foo|Hello World!|http://example.com/foo

   The default meta fields values could also be specified as:

    #PREFIX: {+ID}
    #TARGET: {+ID}
    #MESSAGE: {annotation}

   Another possible serialization is:

    #PREFIX: http://example.org/
    #TARGET: http://example.com/
    #MESSAGE: Hello {annotation}

    foo|World!

   The link line in this example is equal to:

    foo|World!|foo

   Multiple occurrences of equal links in one BEACON file SHOULD be
   ignored.  It is RECOMMENDED to indicate duplicated links with a
   warning.

2.2.  Relation types

   All links in a link dump share a common relation type.  A relation
   type is either an URI or a registered link type from the IANA link
   relations registry [RFC5988].  The relation type is specified by the
   "relation" meta field in BEACON files (Section 3).

   Some examples of relation types:

3.  Meta fields

   A link dump SHOULD contain a set of meta fields, each identified by
   its name build of lowercase letters "a-z".  Relevant meta fields for
   description of the source and target datasets (Section 3.1), the link
   dump (Section 3.2), and links (Section 3.3) are defined in the
   following.  Additional meta fields, not defined in this
   specification, SHOULD be ignored.  All meta field values MUST be
   whitespace-normalized (Section 1.2).  Missing meta field values and
   empty strings MUST be set to the field's default value, which is the
   empty string unless noted otherwise.  The following diagram shows
   which meta fields belong to which dataset:

   +----------------+    +-----------------+     +-----------------+
   | source dataset | ---| link dump       |---> | target dataset  |
   |----------------|    |-----------------|     |-----------------|

3.1.  Source and target datasets

   The set that all source URIs in a link dump originate from is called
   the *source dataset* and the set that all target URIs originate from
   is called the *target dataset*.

3.1.1.  sourceset

   The source dataset can be identified by the sourceset meta field,
   which MUST be an URI if given.  This field replaces the blank node
   ":sourceset".

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


3.1.2.  targetset

   The target dataset can be identified by the targetset meta field,
   which MUST be an URI if given.  This field replaces the blank node
   ":targetset".

3.1.3.  name

   The name meta field contains a name or title of target dataset.  This
   field is mapped to the RDF property "dcterms:title".  For instance
   the name meta field value "ACME documents" can be mapped to this RDF
   triple:

   :targetset dcterms:title "ACME documents" .

3.1.4.  institution

   The institution meta field contains the name or URI of the
   organization or of an individual responsible for making available the
   target dataset.  This field is mapped to the RDF property
   "dcterms:publisher".  For instance the institution meta field value
   "ACME" can be mapped to this RDF triple:

   :targetset dcterms:publisher "ACME" .

3.2.  Link dump

3.2.1.  description

   The description meta field contains a human readable description of
   the link dump.  This field is mapped to the "dcterms:description" RDF
   property.  For instance the description meta field value "Mapping
   from ids to documents" can be mapped to this RDF triple:

   :dump dcterms:description "Mapping from ids to documents" .

3.2.2.  creator

   The creator meta field contains the URI or the name of the person,
   organization, or a service primarily responsible for making the link
   dump.  This field is mapped to the "dcterms:creator" RDF property.
   The creator is an instace of the class "foaf:Agent".

   For instance the following creator meta field values:

   "Bea Beacon"

   "http://example.org/people/bea"

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   can be mapped the the following RDF triples, respectively:

   :dump dcterms:creator "Bea Beacon" .
   :dump dcterms:creator [ a foaf:Agent ; foaf:name "Bea Beacon" ] .

   :dump dcterms:creator <http://example.org/people/bea> .
   <http://example.org/people/bea> a foaf:Agent .

   This field SHOULD NOT contain a simple URL unless this URL is also
   used as URI.

3.2.3.  contact

   The contact meta field contains an email address or similar contact
   information to reach the creator of the link dump.  The field value
   SHOULD be a mailbox address as specified in section 3.4 of [RFC5322],
   for instance:

    admin@example.com

    Bea Beacon <bea@example.org>

   The contact meta field is mapped to the "foaf:mbox" and to the
   "foaf:name" RDF properties.  The domain of the the contact meta field
   is the BEACON dump.  The sample field values can be mapped to:

    :dump dcterms:creator [
        foaf:mbox <mailto:admin@example.com>
    ] .

    :dump dcterms:creator [
        foaf:name "Bea Beacon" ;
        foaf:mbox <mailto:bea@example.org>
    ] .

3.2.4.  homepage

   The homepage field contains an URL of a website with additional
   information about this link dump.  This field corresponds to the RDF
   property "foaf:homepage" with "dump" as subject.  Note that this
   field does not specify the homepage of the target dataset.

   :dump foaf:homepage <http://example.org/about.html> .

3.2.5.  feed

   The feed field contains an URL, where to download the link dump from.
   This field corresponds to the RDF property "void:dataDump".  An
   example mapped to an RDF triple:

   :dump void:dataDump <http://example.com/beacon.txt> .

3.2.6.  timestamp

   The timestamp field contains the date of last modification of the
   link dump.  Note that this value MAY be different to the last
   modification time of a BEACON file that serializes the link dump.
   The timestamp value MUST conform to the "full-date" or to the "date-
   time" production rule in [RFC3339].  In addition, an uppercase "T"
   character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase
   "Z" character MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone
   offset.  This field corresponds to the "dcterms:modified" property.

   For instance the following valid timestamp values:

    2012-05-30
    2012-05-30T15:17:36+02:00
    2012-05-30T13:17:36Z

   can be mapped to the following RDF triples, respectively:

    :dump dcterms:modified "2012-05-30"
    :dump dcterms:modified "2012-05-30T15:17:36+02:00"
    :dump dcterms:modified "2012-05-30T13:17:36Z"

3.2.7.  update

   The update field specifies how frequently the link dump is likely to
   change.  The field corresponds to the "<changefreq>" element in
   Sitemaps XML format [Sitemaps].  Valid values are:

   o  "always"

   o  "hourly"

   o  "daily"

   o  "weekly"

   o  "monthly"

   o  "yearly"

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   o  "never"

   The value "always" SHOULD be used to describe link dumps that change
   each time they are accessed.  The value "never" SHOULD be used to
   describe archived link dumps.  Please note that the value of this tag
   is considered a hint and not a command.

   The RDF property of this field is "rssynd:updatePeriod".

3.3.  Link description

3.3.1.  prefix

   The prefix field specifies an URI patter to construct link sources.
   If no prefix field is specified, the default value "{+ID}" is used.
   If the prefix field contains no template expression, the expression
   "{ID}" is appended.

   The name "prefix" was choosen to keep backwards compatibility with
   existing BEACON files.

   Applications MAY map the prefix field to the RDF property
   "void:uriSpace" or "void:uriRegexPattern" with ":sourceset" as RDF
   subject.

3.3.2.  target

   The target field specifies an URI patter to construct link targets.
   If no target field is specified, the default value "{+ID}" is used.
   If the target field contains no template expression, the expression
   "{ID}" is appended.

   Applications MAY map the target field to the RDF property
   "void:uriSpace" or "void:uriRegexPattern" with ":targetset" as RDF
   subject.

3.3.3.  message

   The message field is used as template for link annotations.  The
   default value is "{annotation}".

3.3.4.  relation

   The relation field specifies the relation type for all links in a
   link dump.  The field value MUST be an URI.  The default relation
   type is "rdfs:seeAlso".  This field is mapped to the RDF property
   "void:linkPredicate" with subject ":dump".

3.3.5.  annotation

   The annotation field specifies the RDF property between link target
   and link annotation.  The default value is "rdf:value" having no
   specific meaning [RDF].

4.  BEACON files

4.1.  BEACON text format

   A BEACON text file is an UTF-8 encoded Unicode file [RFC3629], split
   into lines by line breaks (rule "LINEBREAK").  The file consists of a
   set of lines with meta fields, followed by a set of lines with link
   tokens.  A BEACON text file MAY begin with an Unicode Byte Order Mark
   and it SHOULD end with a line break:

    BEACONTEXT  =  [ BOM ] [ START ]
                   *METALINE
                   *EMPTY
                    LINKLINE *( LINEBREAK LINKLINE )
                   [ LINEBREAK ]

    BOM         =  %xEF.BB.BF     ; Unicode UTF-8 Byte Order Mark

   The order of meta lines and of link lines, respectively, is
   irrelevant.  At least one empty line SHOULD be used to separate meta
   lines and link lines.  If no empty line is given, the first link line
   MUST NOT begin with ""#"".

   EMPTY        =  *WHITESPACE LINEBREAK

   The BEACON text file SHOULD start with a fixed meta field:

    START       =  "#FORMAT:" +WHITESPACE "BEACON" *WHITESPACE LINEBREAK

   A meta line specifies a meta field (Section 3) and its value.  Meta
   field names MUST be given in uppercase letters.  All meta lines with
   "METAFIELD" not one of the field names defined in this specification,
   SHOULD be ignored.

    METALINE    =  "#" METAFIELD ":" METAVALUE LINEBREAK

    METAFIELD   =  +( %x41-5A )   ;  "A" to "Z"

    METAVALUE   =  LINE

   Each link is given on a link line with its source token, optionally
   follwed by annotation token and target token:

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


    LINKLINE    =  SOURCE [
                     VBAR ANNOTATION /
                     VBAR ANNOTATION VBAR TARGET /
                     VBAR TARGET
                   ]

    SOURCE      =  TOKEN

    TARGET      =  TOKEN

    ANNOTATION  =  TOKEN

   The ambiguity of rule "LINKLINE" with one occurrence of "VBAR" is
   resolved is following:

   o  If the target meta field has its default value "{+ID}", and the
      message meta field has its default value "{annotation}", and the
      normalized second token begins with "http:" or "https:", then the
      second token is used as target token.

   o  The second token is used as annotation token otherwise.

   This way one can use two forms to encode links to HTTP URIs (given
   target meta field and message meta field with their default values):

   foo|http://example.org/foobar
   foo||http://example.org/foobar

4.2.  BEACON XML format

   A BEACON XML file is a valid XML file conforming to the following
   schema.  The file SHOULD be encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  The file
   MUST:

   o  Begin with an opening "<beacon>" tag and end with a closing "</
      beacon>" tag.

   o  Specify the default namespace "http://purl.org/net/example".

   o  Include an empty "<link/>" tag for each link.

   o  Include the source token as XML attribute "source" of each "<link/
      >" element.

   The file MAY further:

   o  Specify meta fields (Section 3) as XML attributes to the
      "<beacon>" tag.



Voss, et al.              Expires July 5, 2014                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   o  Specify link tokens "target" and/or "annotation" as attributes to
      the "<link>" element.

   All attributes MUST be given in lowercase.  An informal schema of
   BEACON XML files is given in Appendix B.

   To process BEACON XML files, a complete and stream-processing XML
   parser, for instance the Simple API for XML [SAX], is RECOMMENDED, in
   favor of parsing with regular expressions or similar methods prone to
   errors.  Additional XML attributes of "<link>" elements and "<link>"
   elements without "source" attribute SHOULD be ignored.

   Note that in contrast to BEACON text files, link tokens MAY include
   line breaks, which MUST BE removed by whitespace normalization.
   Furthermore id field, annotation field and target token MAY include a
   vertical bar, which MUST be replaced by the character sequence "%7C"
   before further processing.

5.  Mappings

   An important use-case of BEACON is the creation of HTML links as
   described in section Section 5.2.  A link dump can also be mapped to
   an RDF graph (Section 5.1) so BEACON provides a RDF serialization
   format for a subset of RDF graphs with uniform links.

5.1.  Mapping to RDF

   The following triples are always assumed in mappings of link dumps to
   RDF:

    :sourceset a void:Dataset .
    :targetset a void:Dataset .

    :dump a void:Linkset ;
        void:subjectsTarget :sourceset ;
        void:objectsTarget :targetset .

   Each link can be mapped to at least one RDF triple with:

   o  the source URI used as subject IRI,

   o  the relation type used as predicate,

   o  the target URI used as object IRI.

   As RDF is not defined on URIs but on URI references or IRIs, all URIs
   MUST be transformed to an IRI by following the process defined in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC3987].  Applications MAY reject mapping link dumps



Voss, et al.              Expires July 5, 2014                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   with relation type from the IANA link relations registry, in lack of
   official URIs.  Another valid solution is to extend the RDF model by
   using blank nodes as predicates.

   The annotation SHOULD result in an additional RDF triple, unless its
   value equals to the empty string.  The additional triple is mapped
   with:

   o  the target URI used as subject IRI,

   o  the "annotation" meta field used as predicate,

   o  the annotation value used as literal object.

   Applications MAY ignore annotations and map annotations to different
   kinds of RDF triples if the "annotation" meta field is the default
   value "rdf:value".  For instance an annotation could contain
   additional information about a link such as its provenience, date, or
   probability (reification).

   Typical use cases of annotations include specification of labels and
   a "number of hits" at the target dataset.  For instance the following
   BEACON file in BEACON text format (Section 4.1):

    #PREFIX: http://example.org/
    #TARGET: http://example.com/
    #RELATION: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/primaryTopic
    #ANNOTATION: http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent

    abc|12|xy

   is mapped to the following RDF triples:

    <http://example.org/abc> foaf:primaryTopic <http://example.com/xy> .
    <http://example.com/xy> dcterms:extent "12" .

5.2.  Mapping to HTML

   This document does not specify a single mapping of links in a BEACON
   link dump to links in a HTML document, so the following description
   is non-normative.

   A link in a BEACON dump can be mapped to a HTML link ("<a>" element)
   as following:

   o  link source corresponds to the website which a HTML link is
      included at,




Voss, et al.              Expires July 5, 2014                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                   BEACON                     January 2014


   o  link target corresponds to the "href" attribute,

   o  link annotation corresponds to the textual content,

   For instance the following link, given in a BEACON text file:

    http://example.com|example|http://example.org

   can be mapped to the following HTML link:

    <a href="http://example.org">example</a>

   Note that the annotation field value may be the empty string.  In
   practice, additional meta fields SHOULD be used to construct
   appropriate HTML links.  For instance the meta fields

    #RELATION: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/isPrimaryTopicOf
    #SOURCETYPE: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person
    #NAME: ACME documents

   can be used to create a link such as

    <span>
      More information about this person
      <a href="http://example.com/foo">at ACME documents</a>.
    </span>

   because "foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf" translates to "more information
   about", "foaf:Person" translates to "this person", and the target
   dataset's name can be used as link label.

6.  Security Considerations

   Programs should be prepared for malformed and malicious content when
   parsing BEACON files, when constructing links from link tokens, and
   when mapping links to RDF or HTML.  Possible attacks of parsing
   contain broken UTF-8 and buffer overflows.  Link construction can
   result in unexpectedly long strings and character sequences that may
   be harmless when analyzed as parts.  Most notably, BEACON data may
   store strings containing HTML and JavaScript code to be used for
   cross-site scripting attacks on the site displaying BEACON links.
   Applications should therefore escape or filter accordingly all
   content with established libraries, such as Apache Escape Utils.

Appendix B.  RELAX NG Schema for BEACON XML

   Below is a schema of BEACON XML format (Section 4.2) in RELAX NG
   Compact syntax [RELAX-NGC].  The schema is non-normative and given
   for reference only.

   default namespace = "http://purl.org/net/beacon"

   element beacon {
     attribute prefix      { text }.
     attribute target      { text },
     attribute message     { text },
     attribute source      { xsd:anyURI },
     attribute name        { text },
     attribute institution { text },
     attribute description { text },
     attribute creator     { text },
     attribute contact     { text },
     attribute homepage    { xsd:anyURI },
     attribute feed        { xsd:anyURI },

     element link {
       attribute source     { text },
       attribute target     { text }?,
       attribute annotation { text }?,
       empty
     }*
   }

Appendix C.  Example

   A short example of a BEACON XML file is given below:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <beacon xmlns="http://purl.org/net/beacon"
           prefix="http://example.org/"
           target="http://example.com/"
           name="ACME document">
      <link source="alice" target="foo" />
      <link source="bob" />
      <link source="ada" annotation="bar" />
   </beacon>

   The link dump could also be expressed in BEACON text format:

   #PREFIX: http://example.org/
   #TARGET: http://example.com/
   #NAME:   ACME document

   alice||foo
   bob
   ada|bar

   The link dump mapped to RDF:

   @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
   @prefix void: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#> .

   :sourceset a void:Dataset ;
